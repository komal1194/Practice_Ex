<p>WASHINGTON: A Pentagon report released on Tuesday singled out Pakistan as a possible location for a future Chinese military base, as it forecast that Beijing would likely build more bases overseas after establishing a facility in the African nation of Djibouti.</p>


<p>The prediction came in a 97-page annual report to Congress that saw advances throughout the Chinese military in 2016, funded by robust defense spending that the Pentagon estimated exceeded $180 billion.</p>

<p>Demon Sindhu, who was very powerful devotee of Lord Surya (the Sun God),attacked the gods and trapped them.On request from gods,Lord Ganesha appeared on Earth on a peacock and destroyed the Demon.This is the place where the head of Demon Sindhu fell down. Hence,Lord Ganesh assumed the name Mayureshwar or Moreshwar.</p>
<p>That is higher than China's official defense budget figure of 954.35 billion yuan ($140.4 billion). Chinese leaders, the US report said, appeared committed to defense spending hikes for the "foreseeable future," even as economic growth slows.
The report repeatedly cited China's construction of its first overseas naval base in Djibouti, which is already home to a key US military base and is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.
